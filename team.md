# Team

## Curator

Jordan Papaleo

**Time commitment:** Roughly 2-5 hours/week when the conference is 4+ months away and ramps up to 10 hours/week leading up to the conference. The week before the conference is essentially full-time (40+ hours).

## Organizers

These are the subsections of teams that will need to be formed.  Each piece of this is critical to success and volunteering here means we expect your involvement until we cross the finish line :)

**Time commitment:** Organizers time can vary by the responsibility, but 50% of the time commitment of the curator is a good estimate.

## Volunteers

This is the lifeblood of the actual event.  If you just want to help with the event, here is your role.

**Time commitment:** Volunteers should expect to work the duration of the conference plus 1 day on either end for set-up and tear-down.
