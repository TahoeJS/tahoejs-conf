# Team

## Curator

Jordan Papaleo

**Time commitment:** Roughly 2-5 hours/week when the conference is 4+ months away and ramps up to 10 hours/week leading up to the conference. The week before the conference is essentially full-time (40+ hours).

## Organizers

**Time commitment:** Organizers time can vary by the responsibility, but 50% of the time commitment of the curator is a good estimate.

### Website

### CFP/speakers

### Venue/logistics

### Tickets/promotion

### Sponsors

## Volunteers

**Time commitment:** Volunteers should expect to work the duration of the conference plus 1 day on either end for set-up and tear-down.
